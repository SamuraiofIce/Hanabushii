A basic side scroller I made in high school.

V 1.3 is the stable version including enemy spawns, and random terrain generation.

V 1.4 is was an unfinished version which had some issues with the controls, however it added a slide on the s key, and a paralax background along with screen scrolling. I did not spawn enemies in this version, due to the annoyance of interacting with them while testing.
